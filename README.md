# BACON
Python implementation of the BACON algorithms for automated scientific discovery

## Overview
This project aims to implement -- in spirit if not in detail -- the BACON.4 algorithms produced by Pat Langley, Herb Simon, and their collaborators. The original code was written in LISP, and was largely restricted to exact data. Rather than attempt to port this code to Python, this project aims to produce versions of the algorithms for finding quantitative laws and inventing novel intrinsic variables that are not limited by the noise in real-world data. The main reference for these algorithms is:

Langley, Pat, Herbert A. Simon, Gary Bradshaw, and Jan M. Zytkow. _Scientific Discovery: Computational Explorations of the Creative Processes_. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1987.

## Contributors
This project was begun by Dr. Benjamin Jantzen [http://www.ratiocination.org/] in support of the _Philosophy & Physical Computing_ summer school at Virginia Tech ([https://thinkandcode.lib.vt.edu/]). The project has been extended by Molly Hickman.
